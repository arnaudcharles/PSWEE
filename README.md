</div>

It's a console file explorer that allow you to navigate using **WinRM**, you can also do basic commands like add new files/folder, delete, open, move or rename files. Additionally the module is made to work in conjunction with [**PSBITE**](https://github.com/arnaudcharles/PSBITE), with this you can easily edit file on the fly.

## 📄 Prerequisites

- Require PowerShell **7** (Modern Terminal like Windows Terminal for better looking)

- MUST HAVE [**PSBITE**](https://github.com/arnaudcharles/PSBITE) for editing. (Optional if you don't want to edit on the fly)

## 📦 Installation

To install the module from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSWEE/), you can use the following command:

```powershell
Install-PSResource -Name PSWEE
Import-Module -Name PSWEE
```

## 🔩 Example of Usage

### Find more examples

To find more examples of how to use the module, please refer to the [examples](examples) folder. Some view are available in [Views](./views/Start-PSWEE.md)

Alternatively, you can use the Get-Command -Module 'PSWEE' to find more commands that are available in the module.
To find examples of each of the commands you can use Get-Help -Examples 'CommandName'.

## 📌 How to use it

First you need to run the function ```Start-PSWEE```

Simply navigate with the **UP** and **DOWN** arrow, **ENTER** to go further and **BACKSPACE** to return. **Q** is used to **Exit**.

We highly depend on **ALT** to interact.


* **ALT+G** -> If you know the path where you need to go, type or copy your path.
* **ALT+N** -> To create a file or folder, Let it empty to cancel.
* **ALT+R** -> To rename a file or folder. Let it empty to cancel.
* **ALT+E** -> To edit the file using PSBITE.
* **ALT+D** -> Duplicate file or folder with the same name + random number
* **ALT+M** -> Move file or folder. You can type the path or use the explorer to move where you want, if you do simply press again ALT+M to confirm the move.
* **ALT+P** -> Show the properties.
* **DEL**   -> Delete file or folder after confirmation.


## 📰 How it started

Since I was using core server, as soon as I needed to manipulate file, logs or create file without GUI it was honestly a nightmare. Not user friendly at all because you need to remind yourself the path, sometime several path and on daily use it's just a waste of time. As Microsoft is not providing built-in tool for this and because I'm working in a high secure area, we cannot afford to install cosmetic or non approved software. This is where the creation of this module started, because custom and selfmade PowerShell module are already running why not creating mine that can benefit my daily work and help the community ?

I already made [**PSBITE**](https://github.com/arnaudcharles/PSBITE) that is for me solving one issue and I wanted to make something link to it to benefit from both projects.
